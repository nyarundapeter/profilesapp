# AWS Amplify Full-Stack Web App Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the AWS Amplify full-stack web application tutorial. 
[AWS Amplify Full-Stack Web App Tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-web-app-s3-lambda-api-gateway-dynamodb/)
The tutorial walked me through building a React application with authentication, database integration, and serverless functionality using various AWS services.

## What I Built

Through this tutorial, I learned how to:

- Deploy a React application on AWS's global CDN using Amplify Console
- Add user authentication (sign-up and sign-in functionality)
- Create and integrate a real-time API with a DynamoDB database
- Implement a Lambda function that captures user emails upon sign-up

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify Console

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorial was divided into six main tasks:

1. Create Web App - Deploying static resources via AWS Amplify Console
2. Build Serverless Function - Creating a function with AWS Lambda
3. Create Data Table - Setting up persistence with Amazon DynamoDB
4. Link Serverless Function to Web App - Integrating Lambda with API Gateway
5. Add Interactivity - Modifying the frontend to interact with the backend
6. Clean Up Resources - Removing all created AWS resources

## Getting Started

To run this project yourself, you'll need:
- An AWS account with administrator-level access
- Nodejs and npm installed
- AWS profile configured for local development
- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Git

## Notes

This project was a great introduction to AWS cloud services and serverless architecture. I found the step-by-step approach helpful for understanding how different AWS services integrate with each other.
